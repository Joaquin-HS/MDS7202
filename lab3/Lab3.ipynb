dado que hay que considerar `students_grades.json`, se destaca que los registros no están limpios ni en un formato correcto (formato chileno, con duplicados, etc). Obviando este punto, se muestra a continuación un análisis para cada tipo de join:\n","\n","- Outer join: Este formato de join incluye todos los estudiantes de ambos dataframes, es decir, los que están en ambos y en uno o el otro de manera individual. Esto genera un dataframe con un gran número de registros, donde muchos de ellos contienen nulos.\n","\n","- Left join: Este formato de join incluye todos los estudiantes del dataframe original, anexando las notas de `science` y `history` solo si hay coincidencias con el nombre.\n","\n","- Right join: De manera similar al left join, el right join incluye todos los estudiantes del dataframe asociado a las notas de `science` y `history`, agregando la información de `students_grades` solo si hay coincidencias en los nombres.\n","\n","- Inner join: Este tipo de join incluye solamente a los estudiantes que están en ambos dataframes.\n","\n","Se considera que el join más adecuado sería el **inner join**, ya que permite asegurar que solo se incluyan los estudiantes que están en ambos dataframes, evitando registros asociados a personas que no están en la universidad (limpiando filas de ambos dataframes). Es importante destacar que esto no necesariamente generaría el dataframe final totalmente limpio, pero ayuda a reducir un gran número de problemas de limpieza que puede tener cada dataframe."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"4C4veNWQi_3_"},"source":["# Conclusión"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Htu7yQI0i1ic"},"source":["\n","Eso ha sido todo para el lab de hoy, recuerden que el laboratorio tiene un plazo de entrega de una semana y que **los días de atraso no se pueden utilizar para entregas de lab** solo para tareas.
